  WARNING: This type was defined as MinimalAPI on its declaration. Because of that, its properties/methods are inaccessible
  
  * Any property you're adding to AnimMontage and parent class has to be considered for Child Asset
  *
  * Child Asset is considered to be only asset mapping feature using everything else in the class
  * For example, you can just use all parent's setting  for the montage, but only remap assets
  * This isn't magic bullet unfortunately and it is consistent effort of keeping the data synced with parent
  * If you add new property, please make sure those property has to be copied for children.
  * If it does, please add the copy in the function RefreshParentAssetData
