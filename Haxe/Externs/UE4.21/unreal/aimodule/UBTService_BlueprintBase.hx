/**
  Base class for blueprint based service nodes. Do NOT use it for creating native c++ classes!
  
  When service receives Deactivation event, all latent actions associated this instance are being removed.
  This prevents from resuming activity started by Activation, but does not handle external events.
  Please use them safely (unregister at abort) and call IsServiceActive() when in doubt.
