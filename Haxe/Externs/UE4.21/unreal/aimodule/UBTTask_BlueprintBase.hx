  Base class for blueprint based task nodes. Do NOT use it for creating native c++ classes!
  
  When task receives Abort event, all latent actions associated this instance are being removed.
  This prevents from resuming activity started by Execute, but does not handle external events.
  Please use them safely (unregister at abort) and call IsTaskExecuting() when in doubt.
