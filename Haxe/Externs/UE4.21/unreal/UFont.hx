  A font can either be:
    * Runtime cached - The font contains a series of TTF files that combine to form a composite font. The glyphs are cached on demand when required at runtime.
    * Offline cached - The font contains a series of textures containing pre-baked cached glyphs and their associated texture coordinates.
