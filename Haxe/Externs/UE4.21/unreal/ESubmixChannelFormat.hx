/**
  Submix channel format.
  Allows submixes to have sources mix to a particular channel configuration for potential effect chain requirements.
  Master submix will always render at the device channel count. All child submixes will be down-mixed (or up-mixed) to
  the device channel count. This feature exists to allow specific submix effects to do their work on multi-channel mixes
  of audio.
