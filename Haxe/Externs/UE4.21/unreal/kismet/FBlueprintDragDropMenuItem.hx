/**
  At certain times we want a single menu entry that represents a set of
  UBlueprintNodeSpawners (generally when all those UBlueprintNodeSpawners wrap
  the same UField). We do this to keep the menu less jumbled, and instead
  use the drag/drop action to present a sub-menu to the user (so they can pick
  the the node type that they want). We do this with both delegates and
  variable nodes (where the user can pick a getter vs. a setter, etc.).
  
  This class represents those "consolidated" actions, and essentially serves
  as a FDragDropOperation spawner. It wraps a single UBlueprintNodeSpawner (any
  one of the set that it is supposed to represent), that it uses to determine
  the proper FDragDropOperation.
