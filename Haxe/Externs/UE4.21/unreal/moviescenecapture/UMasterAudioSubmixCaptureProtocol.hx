/**
  This is an experimental audio capture implementation which captures the final output from the master submix.
  This requires the new audiomixer (launch with "-audiomixer") and requires that your sequence can be played
  back in real-time (when rendering is disabled). If the sequence evaluation hitches the audio will become
  desynchronized due to their being more time passed in real time (platform time) than in the sequence itself.
