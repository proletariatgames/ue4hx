    Refraction is computed based on the camera vector entering a medium whose index of refraction is defined by the Refraction material input.
    The new medium's surface is defined by the material's normal.  With this mode, a flat plane seen from the side will have a constant refraction offset.
    This is a physical model of refraction but causes reading outside the scene color texture so is a poor fit for large refractive surfaces like water.

  /**
    The refraction offset into Scene Color is computed based on the difference between the per-pixel normal and the per-vertex normal.
    With this mode, a material whose normal is the default (0, 0, 1) will never cause any refraction.  This mode is only valid with tangent space normals.
    The refraction material input scales the offset, although a value of 1.0 maps to no refraction, and a value of 2 maps to a scale of 1.0 on the offset.
    This is a non-physical model of refraction but is useful on large refractive surfaces like water, since offsets have to stay small to avoid reading outside scene color.
