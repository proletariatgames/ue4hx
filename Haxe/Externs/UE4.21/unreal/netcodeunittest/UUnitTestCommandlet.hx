/**
  WARNING: This type was not defined as DLL export on its declaration. Because of that, some of its methods are inaccessible
  
  A commandlet for running unit tests, without having to launch the game client.
  Uses a heavily stripped down game client, with allowances for Slate, and some hacks for enabling proper netcode usage.
  
  Usage:
      "UE4Editor.exe shootergame -run=NetcodeUnitTest.UnitTestCommandlet"
  
  Parameters:
      -UnitTest=UnitTestName
              - Launches only the specified unit test
  
      -UnitTestNoAutoClose
              - Sets the default option for the 'AutoClose' button to False
  
      -UnitTestServerParms="CommandlineParameters"
              - Adds additional commandline parameters to unit test server instances (useful for e.g. unsuppressing specific logs)
  
      -UnitTestClientParms="CommandlineParameters"
              - Adds additional commandline parameters to unit test client instances
  
      -UnitTestClientDebug
              - Launches unit test clients with a valid render interface (so you can interact with the client window), and a larger window
  
      -UnitTestCap=x
              - Caps the maximum number of unit tests that can run at the same time
