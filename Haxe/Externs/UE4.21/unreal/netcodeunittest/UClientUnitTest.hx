/**
  Base class for all unit tests depending upon a MinimalClient connecting to a server.
  The MinimalClient handles creation/cleanup of an entire new UWorld, UNetDriver and UNetConnection, for fast unit testing.
  
  NOTE: See NUTEnum.h, for important flags for configuring unit tests and the minimal client.
  
  In subclasses, implement the unit test within the ExecuteClientUnitTest function (remembering to call parent)
