/**
  UnitTask's are used to implement supporting code for UnitTest's, for handling complex behind-the-scenes setup prior to test execution
  (e.g. primarily for implementing game-specific server/client environment setup), which is shared between many unit tests,
  and which is better to abstract-away from visibility in unit tests themselves, for code clarity.
  
  For example, some games require authentication negotiation before the game client can connect to a server,
  and this is the type of task that UnitTask's are designed for.
  
  Unit tasks that are added to a unit test, must complete execution before the unit test itself can execute.
