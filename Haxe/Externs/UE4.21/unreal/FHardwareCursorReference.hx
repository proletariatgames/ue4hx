    Specify the partial game content path to the hardware cursor.  For example,
      DO:   Slate/DefaultPointer
      DONT: Slate/DefaultPointer.cur
    
    NOTE: Having a 'Slate' directory in your game content folder will always be cooked, if
          you're trying to decide where to locate these cursor files.
    
    The hardware cursor system will search for platform specific formats first if you want to
    take advantage of those capabilities.
    
    Windows:
      .ani -> .cur -> .png
    
    Mac:
      .tiff -> .png
    
    Linux:
      .png
    
    Multi-Resolution Png Fallback
     Because there's not a universal multi-resolution format for cursors there's a pattern we look for
     on all platforms where pngs are all that is found instead of cur/ani/tiff.
