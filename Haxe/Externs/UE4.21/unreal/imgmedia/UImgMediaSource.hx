/**
  Media source for EXR image sequences.
  
  Image sequence media sources point to a directory that contains a series of
  image files in which each image represents a single frame of the sequence.
  BMP, EXR, PNG and JPG images are currently supported. EXR image sequences
  are optimized for performance. The first frame of an image sequence is used
  to determine the image dimensions (all formats) and frame rate (EXR only).
  
  The image sequence directory may contain sub-directories, which are called
  'proxies'. Proxies can be used to provide alternative media for playback
  during development and testing of a game. One common scenario is the use
  of low resolution versions of image sequence media on computers that are
  too slow or don't have enough storage to play the original high-res media.
