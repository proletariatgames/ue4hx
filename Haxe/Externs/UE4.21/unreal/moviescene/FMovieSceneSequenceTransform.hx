/**
  Movie scene sequence transform class that transforms from one time-space to another.
  
  @note The transform can be thought of as the top row of a 2x2 matrix, where the bottom row is the identity:
                      | TimeScale     Offset  |
                      | 0                     1               |
  
  As such, traditional matrix mathematics can be applied to transform between different sequence's time-spaces.
  Transforms apply offset first, then time scale.
