  Abstract base class for media sources.
  
  Media sources describe the location and/or settings of media objects that can
  be played in a media player, such as a video file on disk, a video stream on
  the internet, or a web cam attached to or built into the target device. The
  location is encoded as a media URL string, whose URI scheme and optional file
  extension will be used to locate a suitable media player.
