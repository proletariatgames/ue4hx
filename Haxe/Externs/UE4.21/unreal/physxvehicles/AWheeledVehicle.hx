/**
  WheeledVehicle is the base wheeled vehicle pawn actor.
  By default it uses UWheeledVehicleMovementComponent4W for its simulation, but this can be overridden by inheriting from the class and modifying its constructor like so:
  Super(ObjectInitializer.SetDefaultSubobjectClass<UMyMovement>(VehicleMovementComponentName))
  Where UMyMovement is the new movement type that inherits from UWheeledVehicleMovementComponent
