  This node type acts like a collapsed node, a single node that represents
  a larger sub-network of nodes (contained within a sub-graph). This node will
  take the math expression it was named with, and attempt to convert it into a
  series of math nodes. If it is unsuccessful, then it generates a series of
  actionable errors.
