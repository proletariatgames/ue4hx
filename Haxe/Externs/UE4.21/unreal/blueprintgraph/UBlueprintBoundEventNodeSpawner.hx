  Takes care of spawning UK2Node_Event nodes. Acts as the "action" portion of
  certain FBlueprintActionMenuItems. Will not spawn a new event node if one
  associated with the specified function already exits (instead, Invoke() will
  return the existing one). Evolved from FEdGraphSchemaAction_K2AddEvent and
  FEdGraphSchemaAction_K2ViewNode.
