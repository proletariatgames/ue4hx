/**
  A channel for exchanging actor and its subobject's properties and RPCs.
  
  ActorChannel manages the creation and lifetime of a replicated actor. Actual replication of properties and RPCs
  actually happens in FObjectReplicator now (see DataReplication.h).
  
  An ActorChannel bunch looks like this:
  
  +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | SpawnInfo            | (Spawn Info) Initial bunch only                                           |
  |  -Actor Class        |   -Created by ActorChannel                                                |
