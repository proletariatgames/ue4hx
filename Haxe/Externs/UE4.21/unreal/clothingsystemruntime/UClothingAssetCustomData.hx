  Custom data wrapper for clothing assets
  If writing a new clothing asset importer, creating a new derived custom data is how to store importer (and possibly simulation)
  data that importer will create. This needs to be set to the CustomData member on the asset your factory creates.
  Testing whether a UClothingAsset was made from a custom plugin can be achieved with
  if(AssetPtr->CustomData->IsA(UMyCustomData::StaticClass()))
