  ####
  07 May 2014
  ServerReplicateData array overflow
  
  The ServerReplicateMessageToAIDebugView function used for some
  debugging features is affected by an array overflow with the
  InMessages: ActivateDataView and DeactivateDataView.
  
  This is the same function that was affected by the bug 55 reported
  the 27 March, anyway remember that it's NOT used in shipping builds.
