/**
  This enum controls clipping of widgets in Slate.  By default all SWidgets do not need to clip their children.
  Most of the time, you don't need to clip, the only times it becomes important is when something might become hidden
  due to panning.  You should use this wisely, as Slate can not batch across clipping areas, so if widget A and widget B
  are set to EWidgetClipping::Yes, no drawing that happens inside their widget trees will ever be batch together, adding
  additional GPU overhead.

    are resized to not be able to support the length of the text.  So rather than needing to tag every
    container that could contain text with [Yes], which would result in almost no batching, this mode
    was added to dynamically adjust the clipping if needed.  The reason not every panel is set to OnDemand,
    is because not every panel returns a Desired Size that matches what it plans to render at.
