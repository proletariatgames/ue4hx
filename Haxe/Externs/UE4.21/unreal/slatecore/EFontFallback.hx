  Sets the maximum font fallback level, for when a character can't be found in the selected font set.
  
  UI code that renders strings from a third party (e.g. player chat in a multiplayer game), should restrict font fallback to localized,
  (or to no fallback, if international font isn't important), to prevent potential performance problems.
