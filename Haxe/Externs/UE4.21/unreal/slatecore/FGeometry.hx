/**
  Represents the position, size, and absolute position of a Widget in Slate.
  The absolute location of a geometry is usually screen space or
  window space depending on where the geometry originated.
  Geometries are usually paired with a SWidget pointer in order
  to provide information about a specific widget (see FArrangedWidget).
  A Geometry's parent is generally thought to be the Geometry of the
  the corresponding parent widget.
