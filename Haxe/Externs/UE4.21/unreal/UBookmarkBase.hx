  Bookmarks are objects that can keep track of specific locations within a level or scene, without
  necessarily adding additional actors to that scene.
  
  Different implementations can be used depending on specific needs, and new implementations can
  be generated by implementing a class Derived on UBookmarkBase.
  
  See UBookMark, UBookMark2D, AGameWorldSettings::DefaultBookmarkClass, IBookmarkEditorInteractor.
