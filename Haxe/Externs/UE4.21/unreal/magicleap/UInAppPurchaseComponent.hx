  The CameraCaptureComponent provides access to and maintains state for camera capture functionality.
  The connection to the device's camera is managed internally.  Users of this component
  are able to asynchronously capture camera images and footage to file.  Alternatively,
  a camera image can be captured directly to texture.  The user need only make the relevant
  asynchronous call and then register the appropriate success/fail event handlers for the
  operation's completion.
