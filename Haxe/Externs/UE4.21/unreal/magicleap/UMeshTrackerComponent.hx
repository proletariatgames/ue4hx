  The MeshTrackerComponent class manages requests for environmental mesh data, processes the results and provides
  them to the calling system. The calling system is able request environmental mesh data within a specified area.
  Various other search criteria can be set via this class's public properties.  Mesh data requests are processed
  on a separate thread.  Once a mesh data request has been processed the calling system will be notified via an
  FOnMeshTrackerUpdated broadcast.
